Running Project Map
-----------------------
To run the program you need to install the source code and then run the server from command line :

1. Download the code, either using git -

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/CybrChick007/dissoBuild.git
  ```

  or download and unpack the zip file from github: https://github.com/CybrChick007/dissoBuild

2. To download any libraries the code uses, type:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. Start the server by typing:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

4. The site can then be visited on http://localhost/8080

(as the log in is not fully functional, you can use http://localhost/8080/home.html to access the rest of the site.)
